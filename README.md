# ducky
a collection of "rubber ducky"/badusb scripts

I do not condone the use of the scripts I provide here in illegal activity, I am not responsible for any misdeeds that may be caused by the usage of these scripts.

These scripts have been tested on flipper zero hardware but they should also work on other badusb hardware.

Modification of the DELAY on these scripts may be required if to be run on significantly slower targets. Do not hesitate increasing the delay if any of the scripts don't work or if you anticipate it wont.
