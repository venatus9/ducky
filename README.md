# ducky
a collection of "rubber ducky"/badusb scripts

I do not condone the use of the scripts I provide here in illegal activity, I am not responsible for any misdeeds that may be caused by the usage of these scripts.

These scripts have been tested on flipper zero hardware but they should also work on other badusb hardware.
